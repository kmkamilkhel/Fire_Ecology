This repository contains code and data for mapping burned areas, fire severity, and vegetation recovery using Sentinel-2 imagery. It includes Google Earth Engine scripts for spectral index computation (e.g., NBR, BAIS2, MIRBI, CSI), R scripts for Random Forest-based severity classification, and sample training/validation datasets. The workflow is designed to support reproducible and scalable analysis of fire impacts across heterogeneous landscapes.
